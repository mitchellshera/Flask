#Scripting



A **scripting or script language** is a programming language for a special 

run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks;

the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted, rather than compiled.



Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or [API](wiki/API) calls,

 and the language allows them to be combined into more programs.

Environments that can be automated through scripting include;

 * software applications,

 * web pages within a web browser

 * usage of the shells of operating systems (OS), 

 * embedded systems

 * games.

  

A scripting language can be viewed as a **domain-specific** 
 language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, 
 it is also known as an **extension language**. 
 Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as;

1. Very high-level programming languages, as they operate

  at a high level of abstraction

2. As control languages, 

particularly for job control languages on mainframes.
